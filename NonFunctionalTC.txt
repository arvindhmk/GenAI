                "content": "**Non‑Functional Test Cases (N‑F) – Healthcare Management Portal**  \n*Each test case is grouped by the functional module it validates.  All test cases are written from a quality‑engineer perspective and include the typical test‑case fields (ID, Title, N‑F Category, Objective, Preconditions, Steps, Expected Result, Acceptance Criteria).*\n\n| # | Module | Test‑Case ID | Title (N‑F Category) | Objective / Description | Preconditions | Test Steps | Expected Result | Acceptance Criteria |\n|---|--------|--------------|----------------------|--------------------------|---------------|------------|-----------------|----------------------|\n| 1 | **Appointment Management (Booking / Reschedule / Cancel)** | **TC_NF_01** | **Performance – Booking Load** <br>*Category: Performance / Scalability* | Verify that the system can handle a high volume of concurrent appointment transactions without degradation. | • Test environment mirrors production (same DB, web‑server, network). <br>• Test data: 10,000 active patient accounts. <br>• Load‑testing tool (e.g., JMeter) ready. | 1. Simulate 500 concurrent users each performing a random mix of book, reschedule, and cancel actions over a 5‑minute window.<br>2. Capture response times, error rates, and CPU/Memory usage. | • 95 % of transactions complete within **2 seconds**.<br>• Error rate ≤ **0.5 %**.<br>• No server‑side crashes or DB deadlocks. | System meets performance SLA for peak‑hour appointment traffic. |\n| 2 | **Secure Patient‑Provider Messaging** | **TC_NF_02** | **Security – End‑to‑End Encryption** <br>*Category: Security* | Ensure that all messages exchanged through the portal are encrypted in transit and at rest, and that unauthorized users cannot read them. | • Two test accounts: Patient A and Provider B.<br>• Network sniffer (Wireshark) installed on a monitoring workstation.<br>• Access to encrypted message store (DB). | 1. Patient A sends a message to Provider B.<br>2. Capture the network traffic while the message is transmitted.<br>3. Attempt to read the stored message directly from the DB without using the application layer. | • Network packets show only TLS‑encrypted payload (no plain‑text).<br>• Direct DB read returns ciphertext; decryption requires application key. | Encryption meets **HIPAA‑required AES‑256** standards; no plaintext leakage observed. |\n| 3 | **Medical Records Viewer (Records, Lab Results, Medication History)** | **TC_NF_03** | **Usability – Record Retrieval Time** <br>*Category: Usability / Performance* | Confirm that a patient can locate and view any of their medical documents quickly, supporting a good user experience. | • Patient account with ≥ 200 records (lab, imaging, prescriptions). <br>• Browser window opened and logged in. | 1. Navigate to “My Medical Records”.<br>2. Select a random record from the list.<br>3. Measure time from click to full rendering of the document. | • Record loads and renders in **≤ 1.5 seconds** on a standard broadband connection (10 Mbps). | Meets usability target of < 2 seconds for record access, as defined by UX guidelines. |\n| 4 | **Automated Appointment Reminders (SMS / Email)** | **TC_NF_04** | **Reliability – Delivery Success Rate** <br>*Category: Reliability* | Validate that reminder notifications are reliably delivered to the patient’s chosen channel (SMS or email) within the expected window. | • Patient profile with valid phone number and email address.<br>• Reminder service configured to send 24 hrs before appointment.<br>• Access to SMS gateway logs and email SMTP logs. | 1. Schedule an appointment for tomorrow.<br>2. Trigger the reminder engine (or wait for scheduled run).<br>3. Check SMS gateway and email logs for delivery status.<br>4. Verify patient receipt (optional: ask patient to confirm). | • Delivery status = **Delivered** for ≥ **99 %** of messages.<br>• Reminder arrives **±5 minutes** of the scheduled send time. | System satisfies reliability SLA for patient notifications. |\n| 5 | **Pre‑Visit Paperwork Submission** | **TC_NF_05** | **Compatibility – Cross‑Browser Support** <br>*Category: Compatibility* | Ensure that the online pre‑visit forms function correctly on all supported browsers and devices. | • List of supported browsers/devices (e.g., Chrome 118, Edge 118, Safari 17 on macOS, Firefox 119, iOS Safari, Android Chrome). <br>• Test accounts with pending pre‑visit forms. | For each browser/device: <br>1. Log in and navigate to “Pre‑Visit Paperwork”.<br>2. Fill out all required fields (including file upload).<br>3. Submit the form.<br>4. Observe UI behavior, validation messages, and successful submission confirmation. | • Form renders correctly (no layout breakage).<br>• All client‑side validations fire.<br>• Submission succeeds and confirmation appears within **2 seconds**. | Compatibility matrix shows **100 %** pass rate across all listed browsers/devices. |\n\n### How to Use These Test Cases\n1. **Map to Test Plan** – Insert each N‑F test case into the appropriate section of your overall test plan (Performance, Security, Usability, Reliability, Compatibility).  \n2. **Define Test Data** – Populate the required patient/clinician records, appointment slots, and communication endpoints before execution.  \n3. **Automate Where Feasible** – Load, performance, and compatibility tests can be automated with tools such as JMeter, Selenium Grid, or BrowserStack.  \n4. **Report Results** – Capture metrics (response times, error rates, encryption verification, delivery logs) and compare against the acceptance criteria listed.  \n\nThese five non‑functional test cases provide coverage for the most critical quality attributes of the **Patient Management & Access** and **Clinician/Provider** modules of the healthcare management system.",
                "reasoning": "The user wants \"Generate Non Functional Test cases for the User Story related to Healthcare Management provided below\". They want 5 Non Functional Test cases, segregated module wise. The user story includes patient management and access, clinician and provider functionality. So we need to produce 5 NFR test cases, grouped by modules (e.g., Appointment Management, Messaging, Medical Records, Notification, Pre‑Visit Paperwork, Clinician Portal, Mobile Access, Referral Engine, Medication Alert). Provide test case ID, title, description, preconditions, steps, expected result, NFR type (e.g., performance, security, usability, reliability, compatibility, scalability). Provide maybe priority. The user also gave a weird last instruction: \"Act as Business Analyst to review the code Output Format Generate the testcase\". Probably they want a table format.\n\nWe should comply with policy: no disallowed content. Provide test cases. No code. Provide clear output.\n\nLet's produce something like:\n\n**Module: Appointment Management**\n- TC_NF_01 Performance – Appointment Booking Load\n\n**Module: Secure Messaging**\n- TC_NF_02 Security – Message Encryption\n\n**Module: Medical Records Viewer**\n- TC_NF_03 Usability – Record Retrieval Time\n\n**Module: Notification Service**\n- TC_NF_04 Reliability – Reminder Delivery Rate\n\n**Module: Pre‑Visit Paperwork**\n- TC_NF_05 Compatibility – Browser Compatibility\n\nProvide details.\n\nLet's produce final answer."
